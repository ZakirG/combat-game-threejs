Inside the _docs folder, you can see many new markdown documents that I've created in the process of planning new features and attempting to fix bugs. Some of them came in handy, some did not. Some of them were for bugs that I attempted to fix and was not able to just yet. I created most of these since the last submission in the last few days.

Below is a journey through my planning stages of this game. Prompts I asked LLMs 
are included, their responses are not included.

## Prompts to ChatGPT:

If I built a game that I wanted to sell, what are all my different options for selling that game? I have not yet built it, so I could use a variety of tech stacks, but I know that it should be used by people who are on a computer. So what are my options for selling this game?


What are all the major different formats for games that you can play in multiplayer like, you know, racing games, 2D fighting games, 3D flight simulators, 3D racing games, and so on. meant to be played on a computer?


If I wanted to make a 3D game with cool 3D models in it, first of all, where on the internet can I find free 3D models that are cool? And second of all, is there good AI generation technology for 3D models that includes textures?


If I wanted to make a game using Unreal Engine 5 that works on Mac as a desktop app, is that possible?


write a function in C# to transpose a matrix. (i was curious about C# syntax)


Tell me about the Unity game engine. If I'm building a game in Unity, will I actually be writing quite a lot of code in C#? And can I edit that code using cursor IDE?


When you finish making a game in Unity and you want to play it or like export it, if you're on Mac, can you turn it into a DMG or like, I don't know, like a Mac app that runs?


I want to build a multiplayer 3D game. It could be a web game, or it could be deployed on like Steam or something, or it could be like a DMG for Mac users or something built with Electron. What are all my options for tech stacks I could use? It should be for people who play using computers. That's about all the requirements i have



I like option 4, Electronapp. I love that it is easy to distribute DMG files. When you say that it is heavy, how large of a file would a 3D game be? It's only going to be about a week's worth of development because I'm building it for a class project. But I will want it to have a lot of nice 3d models in it if possible.





3D Electron Boiler Plate sounds great. Definitely find some for me, but that's also not enough because I need... Multiplayer Support. How will I build multiplayer support? I would love to have a template of something or an existing game engine. Maybe you can find some open source games that are already built in Electron that use... like a third person view behind a character or something. I really want to build a 3D game with a third person view where you control a character that runs around and There are also other people who are in the same space that you fight.





Okay, let's backtrack. Tell me more about option 2 of building with the Unity game engine. Are there multiplayer 3D, humanoid, open source templates that I could build off of?



How would I install Unreal Engine 5 on Mc Sequoia so that I could build a game? How would I do that from start to finish?



how do people play FPS games on a laptop without a mouse? is that possible?


Find a third person melee sword game I can play in 3D online on my computer on some website.


If I'm building a game in Unity where it's multiplayer and people have... ...swords. And we both strike each other at the same time. How would I make it so that our swords hit each other? And there's an animation that shows that our swords hit each other. And neither of us get hurt. How do you implement that?




i'm no mac sequoia. which unity should i download? am i on arm64


what does replication mean in the context of multiplayer games unreal engine 5

I have a Mac M4 Pro MacBook 14 inch on Sequoia with 236 gigabytes of disk space free and 24 gigabytes of memory. Is that good enough to run Unreal Engine 5.6?



my game concept:
Game concept:
Souls-like game, the format is similar to God of War Ragnarok or Star Wars Battlefront 2015, except it's third person perspective Souls-like format, and the camera zooms out a bit farther.
(extra credit: you can swap to FPS mode when you switch to ranged weapons like bows and arrows.).
It's a multiplayer map where anyone can drop in, there are two teams. if you're single player that's fine. each team has its own NPCs. you kill the other team's NPCs. You choose your team before joining the game, so you can do either multiplayer coop or multiplayer PVP.
There are tons of NPCs, most of them are one-hit KO, some of them of two-hit KO, and they run pretty fast, same speed as you. The terrain is massive, you run fast, the enemies explode and go flying when you slice them or shoot them. Everything is designed to make you feel extremely powerful.
Move around with the arrow keys or WASD. Change perspective with the mouse.
Make attacks with ASD or IOP. you can choose your controller style in a menu.
Would be really sick to have vehicles. Like horses and dragons.
You have a character that looks sick as fuck that can run really, really fast and jump really, really high. in massive nature landscapes. There are AI zombie type enemies that explode into blood when you hit them. And their limbs fall off when you slice them. And it's Super Gory. Tons and tons of blood. Spurting out. And you also fight other people in the same game. When you kill the AI enemies, you get your magic bar refilled. Your magic bar lets you Use a shield to defend yourself when anything attacks, but especially humans. The AI enemies appear in massive hordes and all of them can be killed with one hit. And when you hit them they go flying backwards while dissolving into pieces. Because you are so incredibly powerful. This game is the absolute pinnacle of power fantasy. 
Research on the internet and make a big list, as big as you can, of Unreal Engine 5 templates that I could use to build this game. The game must be multiplayer, and souls-like with melee combat. Any other extra features are a bonus, but those are the bare minimum -- multiplayer and souls-like combat. What templates could I use for Unreal Engine 5 to make this possible? Ideally we would be using C++ Not blueprints.  I need to build this game as quickly as possible,  Ideally in two days.  I am on Mac, Sequoia. Please find templates online and any other resources that would make building this go quickly and easily while reusing as much existing code on the internet as possible.  I will also be using cursor IDE,  Hence the C++ intention.



can i use cursor IDE to develop for unreal engine 5 even if i use Blueprints?



when you make a game in unreal engine 5 on mac, what is the output file you distribute?



If I do game dev with Unreal Engine 5 and mixamo, do I need Blender?


how do i generate images with midjourney



generate an image of a video game character on a black background. the art style is 3d, high resolution, from a AAA game, unreal engine 5.6. this character's name is Jaguar. he is extremely muscular, extremely ripped, jacked, wide shoulders, very muscular, a hulking figure. he is of arab ethnicity. he is shirtless and covered in abstract tribal tattoos. he has a gold link necklace on with a jaguar-head pendant. his pants are martial artist pants, like Goku from dragonball z. his shoes look like the shoes in the attached image. his face looks like the faces in the attached images. notice the double nose stud and the facial hair on the attached face, these are important details. for the texture on the pants and general aesthetic, take reference from the attached image of the dark knight. for the character's musculature and body form and stature, take reference from the attached image of the hulk.

generate a view of this tattoo character from the back. for his back muscles, take reference from the attached green hulk image. 


i need a reliable and free image inpainting tool that uses AI. find me options


meshy ai messed up a body part. can i regenerate just that body part?


[game concept from above]

can you browse a unity codebase using cursor IDE ? can it see all files?Â 

can you use mixamo animations in godot

what is unity editor? is that different from unity?


can you import 3d models from meshyAI into threejs

If I already have a 3d model as an fbx file, can I skin it using images on some AI tool on the internet? What are my options for that? 


I have a 3D model that I generated with Hyper3D. The texture files are separate from the FBX as PNG files. I have created animations for it using Mixamo and downloaded the FBX files for those animations. Now I'm going to import to threejs. How will I get the textures on the model?


I have a 3js game. I want it to be highly performant. It will be multiplayer. I need to spawn a very large amount of enemies. How can I approach this in a way that maintains a high framerate?

I want to build a simple NPC AI system for my zombie game. Are there any templates online for 3JS that could help me? I want to spawn hordes of 25 enemies and have them randomly move around but still chase the player and not all do the same thing and have different, you know, random choices of behaviors. Maybe I can build it myself, but is there a certain algorithm that you'd recommend? So the zombie can walk, or it can choose to run, it can choose to do a screen animation, like a taunt, it can choose to do an attack, it can choose to follow the player, or it can choose to go in some other direction. Should I just do random dice rolls for each one? But I have a swarm of 25, so there will be overlap, I guess. What's a good algorithm?



I have a 3d model of the character unequipped. I want to create an equip system in 3js so that the character can pick up a weapon. Once they pick up the weapon, which is a sword or a shield, but starting with just a sword, we should be changing their walking animations, their running animations, and their fighting animations. And they should actually be holding the weapon. I can change the animation logic, that's fine. But how do I get them to actually hold the weapon in 3js? Do I need to embed it in the model itself, in the FBX file, or what?
